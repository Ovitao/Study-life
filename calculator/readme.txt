      Core of the program drawn from book. As specific tasks from the book or based on my desire, new functions have been added .
      As an exercise to choose how to improve the program, developed a Numeral System conversion that supports Binary, Hexadecimal, Decimal, and Octal numeral systems. 
	Also added :
	negative numerals support for bin, oct and hex
	roman_int conversions
	file streams with comands for input and output.
	element() that handles square root, to the power of, and factorial
	simbol table class
	Constants for Variables (Simbols)
	Other.cpp/h with some helper functions.	
	help() section
 	
      Some other minor changes were made, but can't really remember them all.
      The core, description comment and help_list is in the "calculator.cpp" .
